        "\n",
        "Minimizing Errors: The method aims to minimize the overall error in the predictions. By squaring the residuals, the method ensures that positive and negative errors do not cancel each other out and that larger errors are given more weight.\n",

        "Line of Best Fit: The regression line obtained through the least squares method is the one that best represents the data according to the criterion of minimum squared error. This line minimizes the vertical distances between the observed data points and the predicted values.\n",

        "Optimization: The least squares method involves solving a set of equations to find the optimal values of the slope (\n",
        "𝑚\n",
        ") and intercept (\n",
        "𝑐\n",
        ") of the regression line. These values are calculated to ensure the smallest possible sum of squared residuals.\n",
