        "\n",
        "Logistic Regression and Linear Regression are both statistical models used for predictive analysis, but they serve different purposes:\n",
        "\n",
        "Linear Regression is used for predicting continuous numerical values. It establishes a linear relationship between independent and dependent variables, meaning it assumes the output variable changes in a straight-line fashion with the input variables.\n",
        "\n",
        "Logistic Regression is used for classification problems, where the output is categorical (e.g., yes/no, spam/not spam). Instead of predicting a continuous value, it predicts the probability that an observation belongs to a particular category. The output is then mapped to a discrete class using a threshold (e.g., if probability > 0.5, classify as one category; otherwise, classify as another).\n",
        "\n",
        "Key Differences:\n",
        "Nature of Output: Linear Regression predicts continuous values, while Logistic Regression predicts categorical outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Linearity Assumption: Linear Regression assumes a direct linear relationship between variables, while Logistic Regression applies a transformation (sigmoid function) to constrain outputs between 0 and 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Use Case:\n",
        "Linear Regression is used in regression tasks (e.g., predicting house prices), whereas Logistic Regression is used in classification tasks (e.g., spam detection).\n",
        "\n",
        "Interpretation: In Linear Regression, the coefficients represent the rate of change of the dependent variable. In Logistic Regression, the coefficients influence the probability of belonging to a class rather than a direct output."

        "Prevents Overfitting: In logistic regression, when the model is too complex or trained on a small dataset, it may learn patterns that are too specific to the training data, leading to poor performance on new data. Regularization helps by discouraging excessive complexity.\n",
